# VBA-challenge - FR

This repository contains files (No: 4) showcasing the analysis of stock exchange data for the years 2018-2020 as part of the VBA script writing challenge.

The data was analysed to find (a) yearly change, calculated from stocks values starting from the beginning of the year upto the end of that specific year,
(b) the associated percentage of stocks for the year, (c) the "ticker" symbol and (d) the total stock volume.
Finally, conditional formating was used to differentiate total stock volume based on its value either being < or > 0.
 
VBS script that was used to analyse the data has also been included. This script loops through the stock market data for the particular year and
produces the above outputs (a - d).
